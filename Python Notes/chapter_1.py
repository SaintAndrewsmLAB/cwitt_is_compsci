#   TERMS:

#       problem solving
#           The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing the solution.

#       high-level language
#           A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

#       low-level language
#           A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called "machine language" or "assembly language."

#       portability
#           A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.

#       interpret
#           To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time.

#       compile
#           To translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.

#       source code
#           A program in a high-level language before being compiled.

#       object code
#           The output of the compiler after it translates the program.

#       executable
#           Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.

#       script
#           A program stored in a file (usually one that will be interpreted).

#       program
#           A set of instructions that specifies a computation.

#       algorithm
#           A general process for solving a category of problems.

#       bug
#           An error in a program.

#       debugging
#           The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of programming errors.

#       syntax
#           The structure of a program.

#       syntax error
#           An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore impossible to interpret).

#       runtime error
#           An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute but that prevents the program from continuing.

#       exception
#           Another name for a runtime error.

#       semantic error
#           An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.

#       semantics
#           The meaning of a program.

#       natural language
#           Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.

#       formal language
#           Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages.

#       token
#           One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language.

#       parse
#           To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

#       print statement
#           An instruction that causes the Python interpreter to display a value on the screen.
